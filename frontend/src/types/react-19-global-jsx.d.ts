/**
 * `@types/react@19` dropped the global `JSX` namespace for the scoped `React.JSX`. Console's own code
 * moved over, but third-party packages still reference the global one — notably the react-markdown@8
 * bundled by @redpanda-data/ui@4.2.0, whose `complex-types.ts` ships as source (so `skipLibCheck`
 * can't skip it). This aliases the global namespace back to `React.JSX`; drop it once every consumer
 * is React 19-aware.
