  # Complexity analysis: the recommendations are to be between 10-20, with a
  # default of 30 for gocyclo and gocognit, and a default of 10 for cyclop. We
  # will choose the middle of the range for cyclo analysis, which should be
  # good enough for a lot of cases. We can bump to 20 later if necessary.  The
  # cognitive analysis is a bit overly sensitive for large switch statements
  # (say a function just switches to return a bunch of different strings), so
